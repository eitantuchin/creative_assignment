        <h2>Observations as a Time Traveler</h2>
        <p>
          As I journey back to the Jurassic period, the atmosphere that envelops me is vastly different from what I'm accustomed to in my own time. The air is thicker, richer, and teeming with life.
        </p>
        <p>
          The Jurassic atmosphere is characterized by high levels of oxygen, reaching concentrations of up to 30%, compared to the 21% found in the modern atmosphere. This abundance of oxygen supports the growth of massive plants and fuels the metabolism of the giant dinosaurs that roam the land.
        </p>
        <p>
          However, along with the high oxygen levels, the atmosphere also contains higher concentrations of carbon dioxide, methane, and other greenhouse gases. These gases contribute to the warming of the planet, creating a greenhouse effect that maintains the warm and humid climate of the Jurassic period.

        <h2>Significance of Jurassic Atmosphere</h2>
        <p>
          The composition of the Jurassic atmosphere has significant implications for life on Earth during this time. The high oxygen levels support the growth of diverse plant life, including ferns, cycads, and conifers, which form the basis of terrestrial ecosystems.
        </p>
        <p>
          Additionally, the rich atmosphere provides ample oxygen for the metabolism of large herbivorous dinosaurs, allowing them to grow to massive sizes. This abundance of oxygen also supports the flight of pterosaurs and the evolution of early birds, which take to the skies in search of food.
        </p>
        <p>
          However, the elevated levels of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere contribute to climate instability and environmental challenges. Frequent storms, fluctuations in sea levels, and changes in precipitation patterns shape the Jurassic landscape, driving adaptation and evolution among species.
