        <h2>Observations as a Time Traveler</h2>
        <p>
          As I journey back to the Jurassic period, I witness the Earth undergoing remarkable tectonic transformations. Pangaea, the massive supercontinent, is in the process of breaking apart, reshaping the world as I know it.
        </p>
        <p>
          The tectonic style of this era is dynamic and profound. The once-unified Pangaea is fragmenting into smaller landmasses known as Laurasia and Gondwana. The separation of these continents is driven by the relentless movement of tectonic plates beneath the Earth's crust.
        </p>
        <p>
          Rift valleys and mid-ocean ridges dominate the landscape, evidence of the Earth's crust tearing apart as tectonic plates diverge. The opening of the Atlantic Ocean marks a monumental event in Earth's history, as North America begins its journey away from Europe and Africa.

        <h2>Significant Events Witnessed</h2>
        <p>
          The breakup of Pangaea is a spectacle to behold. As I observe from my vantage point, I witness the birth of new ocean basins and the formation of rift valleys, such as the Central Atlantic Rift System. These rifts serve as scars on the Earth's surface, remnants of a time when continents were united as one.
        </p>
        <p>
          This period of intense tectonic activity sets the stage for the evolution of Earth's continents and oceans, laying the groundwork for the diverse landscapes and ecosystems that will emerge in the millennia to come.
